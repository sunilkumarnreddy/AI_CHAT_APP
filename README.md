# AI Prompt Generator Application

## Overview

This is a robust and friendly web application designed to interact with an AI Language Model API. It allows users to submit text prompts and receive 
meaningful AI-generated responses. The project demonstrates the integration of a React.js frontend with a FastAPI backend.

## Features

- Simple, intuitive, and no-nonsense user interface.
- Real-time communication between frontend and backend.
- Support for AI text generation (integrate your favorite Language Model API).
- Styled with a clean, bold design using CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **API:** OpenAI GPT (or replace with dummy API for testing)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed for the frontend.
- Python 3.x installed for the backend.


### Frontend Setup (React.js)

Set up the React App: Run the following commands to set up your React application under main directory ( AI_APP):

npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend

***code necessary instruction in app.js AND app.css;

Run the Frontend:

npm i
npm start



### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

Navigate to the backend directory.
Install dependencies:


pip install fastapi 
pip install uvicorn

Backend Code: Create a file main.py and code necessary instructions;

Run the Backend: Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main:app --reload


Run the Application
Start both the frontend and backend servers.
Open the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and interact with the app.


Assumptions
The backend uses a dummy response for text generation. Replace this with your Language Model API integration.
